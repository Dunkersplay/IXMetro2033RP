This gamemode was originally made for Terminus Zero Metro Roleplay. Feel free to modify it however you feel.

This version of the gamemode was made as generic as possible for the use by anyone wanting to start a Metro Roleplay server. Some addons may be required, however the only "important" one is the weapons pack, which I posted below. Please keep in mind, the weapons pack TZ used is Russian. If you can find a better one or make a better one, good luck.

The weapons require an addon on TFA base which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1934276433

Make sure you download the original version of Helix. Modify sh_anims for your animations. Most Metro Models either use OTA, Barney, or citizen_male animations/skeleton structures.

Animations for /most/ models is possible. It should be noted that Male Models pack, and the Redux/LL Redux/Exodus pack seem to not like to function with Helix (IX).
